When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm working on a project that collaborates with other users or want to make a cloud backup of the working copies i use remote repository
rather than local working directory.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I don't prefer GitHub to update my repo automatically because I might be woking on a new feature and its half done but if github starts autonmatically updating and might result in a conflict. Which i don't want to happen, I would manually pull from github when its a correct time.
